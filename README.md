**üîÆ Churn Prediction Analysis**

A comprehensive machine learning project for predicting customer churn using multiple algorithms, feature importance analysis, and robust preprocessing.

**üìä Project Overview**

This project implements a complete churn prediction pipeline that:

**Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)**

Handles data preprocessing with mixed data types

Trains and evaluates multiple ML models

Analyzes feature importance

Tests model robustness by removing the most important feature

**üöÄ Features**

Multiple ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Comprehensive EDA: Visualizations for churn distribution, correlations, and categorical analysis

Robust Preprocessing: Handles both numerical and categorical features with proper imputation

Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies and visualizes the most influential features

Model Comparison: Before and after dropping the most important feature

Professional Visualizations: ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance plots


**üìà Expected Output**

The analysis provides:
